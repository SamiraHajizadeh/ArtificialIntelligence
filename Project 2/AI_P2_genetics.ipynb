    "\n",
    "** For having a uniform answer all letters are converted to uppercase.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Part 3\n",

    "In this part we define the fitness function that help us determine the better fit chromosome in the pool. The score returned by the function is the number of decoded words that are available in the global_dict.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Answering the questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Too big or small mating pool: Having a very small mating pool means going through a very small number of states for our answer and can make the time taken to find the answer extremely long. On the other hand, while a large mating pool can grant us checking various states more quickly, it certainly increases the amount of computation needed. As a result a medium sized pool is the best option which will be calculated best by trial and error.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Increasing the size of mating pool will not only imensely magnify the computation time needed (The algorithm does not guarantee returning an answer and searches the space rather randomly.) but also will help reproduce the least fit asnwers as well as the most fit. In other words the competetion aspect of the algorithm will be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To expand the searched space by making random changes sometimes unavailable in the parents. In this way, the effect of the initial randomly selected pool will be decreased and the diversity will improve. || By using the mutation we ensure that it is possible to have features not available in parents for offspring. By using crossover, we try to make better fit solutions in a purposeful way. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Crossover has a higher impact in getting a better precision and usually has a rate between 0.8 and 0.9. On the other hand, the mutation rate is commonly between 0.05 to 0.1 and increases the chance that the algorithm will reach the optimal solution. Because of the randomness in mutation's nature it has a higher influence on the outcome. In other words, adding 5 percent to mutation rate can effect the algorithm far more than adding (or decreasing) 5 percent from the crossover rate. || Summary: An increase in crossover rate can improve the precision rate much more than in mutation. But the effect of certain changes in mutation rate (on precision) is higher and faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. By defining a repetition detection function and increasing the crossover rate and mutation rate (Setting the mutation rate equal to 1), we can possibily solve this problem. But in case the problem persisted, reseting the algorithm (randomly initialzing the pool) will be a good option.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. By using crossover in a loop and assigning a random mating pool at a certain limit we can help the problem with diversity (that is usually solved by mutation.) On the other hand, working on the breading the fittest choices and evolving our answer in every generation is almost impossible by using mutation alone.\n",
